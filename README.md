## Overview

MDML is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for the analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Leveraging the capabilities of`mdml` library, MDML facilitates the loading of MD trajectory data, the featurization of trajectories, the execution of Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) and Variational Autoencoding, and the creation of PLUMED files for biasing simulations based on SFA and VAE components. 

## Custom Installation

Before installing MDML, it is necessary to install a custom version of `sklearnsfa`, which is packaged within the `mdml` repository, as well as msmbuilder2022 found at https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder2022. This ensures compatibility and optimal performance for SFA computations within MDML. Follow these steps to install both the custom `sklearnsfa` and `mdml`:

1. **Install msmbuilder2022 using conda:**
``` conda install -c conda-forge testmsm ```

Alternatively, one can install msmbuilder2022 with pip by cloning the repository at https://github.com/msmbuilder/msmbuilder2022 and running:

``` pip install ./msmbuilder2022 ```

2. **Clone the `mdml` repository to your local machine:**
``` git clone https://github.com/svats73/mdml.git ```

3. **Navigate to the cloned repository directory:**
``` cd mdml ```

4. **Install the custom `sklearnsfa` package:**
``` pip install ./sklearn-sfa ```

5. **Install the `mdml` package:**
``` pip install . ```

This installation process will ensure that you have both the `mdml` tool and the custom `sklearn-sfa` library installed and ready for your MD analysis tasks.

## Usage

The MDML CLI tool supports various commands for processing and analyzing your MD trajectories. Below is a guide to using these commands:

### Loading Trajectories

``` mdml load-trajectories --path_to_trajectories PATH --topology_file FILE --stride N --atom_indices "selection" ```

- `--path_to_trajectories`: Directory containing trajectory files.
- `--topology_file`: Topology file path.
- `--stride`: Interval for loading frames (optional).
- `--atom_indices`: Atom selection string (optional).

### Featurizing Dihedrals

``` mdml featurize --types TYPE1 --types TYPE2 --nosincos ```

- `--types`: Types of dihedrals to featurize. Can specify multiple types, such as chi1, chi2, phi, psi. `--types` must be put before each type input
- `--nosincos`: Disables the sin/cos transformation if set.

### Describing Features

``` mdml describe-features --nosincos ```

- `--nosincos`: Disables the sin/cos transformation if set.

### Dumping Description

``` mdml dump-description --description_file_path PATH --nosincos ```

- `--description_file_path`: File path to save the feature description.
- `--nosincos`: Dump non-transformed feature description if created.

### Dumping Featurized Data

``` mdml dump-featurized --dump_file_path PATH --nosincos ```

- `--dump_file_path`: File path to save the featurized data.
- `--nosincos`: Dump non-transformed features if created.

### Running Slow Feature Analysis (SFA)

``` mdml run-sfa --n_components N --tau T ```

- `--n_components`: Number of SFA components to extract.
- `--tau`: The tau parameter for SFA.

### Creating PLUMED File

``` mdml create-plumed_file --plumed_filename FILENAME ```

- `--plumed_filename`: File path to save the generated PLUMED file.

### Dumping SFA Components

``` mdml dump-sfa-components --save_file FILE ```

- `--save_file`: File path to save the SFA components.

### Cluster on SFA Components

``` mdml cluster --algorithm ALGORITHM_NAME --n_clusters NUMBER_OF_CLUSTERS ```

- `--algorithm`: Name of clustering algorithm to use (currently supporting 'kcenters', 'kmeans', and 'gmm')
- `--n_clusters`: For 'kcenters' and 'kmeans', how many cluster centers to use (optional, unused for 'gmm')

### Dumping structures clustered on SFA Components

``` mdml dump-clusters --num_samples NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES ```

- `--num_samples`: Number of structures to sample from cluster centers generated by clustering to be dumped

### Classify ensembles

``` mdml classify --ensemble_one PATH_TO_FIRST_ENSEMBLES --ensemble_two PATH_TO_SECOND_ENSEMBLES --ensemble_features ```

- `--ensemble_one`: Path to first featurized ensemble of trajectories
- `--ensemble_two`: Path to second featurized ensemble of trajectories
- `--ensemble_features`: Path to dataframe which contains featurization information for the given ensembles

### Train VAE 
 
 ``` md-sfa train-vae --pickle_descriptor PICKLE_DESCRIPTOR_FILE --pickle_features PICKLE_FEATURES_FILE --pickle_features --tau TAU_VALUE ```
 
 - `--pickle_descriptor`: One or more file paths to pickles used as descriptors for the system
 - `--pickle_features`: One or more file paths to pickles used as features for the system
 - `--tau`: Time lag parameter (integer)
 
 NOTE: you can add multiple pickle descriptors/features by adding additional `--pickle_descriptor` flags before additional paths to descriptors/features, ensure that the ordering is the same for descriptors and features 
 
 ### Predict VAE 
 
 ``` md-sfa train-vae --pickle_descriptor PICKLE_DESCRIPTOR_FILE --pickle_features PICKLE_FEATURES_FILE --pickle_features --tau TAU_VALUE --model_path PATH_TO_TRAINED_MODEL --teacher_flag (OPTIONAL)```

 - `--pickle_features`: One or more file paths to pickles used as features for the system
 - `--tau`: Time lag parameter (integer)
 - `--model_path`: Path to model trained on given descriptors and features
 - `--teacher_flag` : Optional flag to make predictions with teacher mode
 
 NOTE: you can add multiple pickle descriptors/features by adding additional `--pickle_descriptor` flags before additional paths to descriptors/features, ensure that the ordering is the same for descriptors and features 

### Dump classified ensembles as a plumed file

``` mdml create-classifier-plumed --plumed_filename FILENAME ```

- `--plumed_filename`: File path to save the generated PLUMED file.


### Dumping SFA Weights as B-Factors

``` mdml plumed-bfactor --dat_file FILE --pdb_input PDB_INPUT_FILE --pdb_output PDB_OUTPUT_FILE ```

### Restarting the Tool

To clear the current state and start fresh:

``` mdml restart ```

This command deletes any serialized state, allowing you to start a new analysis without interference from previous runs.
